/** @class ActionManager
 @brief ActionManager is a singleton that manages all the actions.
 Normally you won't need to use this singleton directly. 99% of the cases you will use the Node interface,
 which uses this singleton.
 But there are some cases where you might need to use this singleton.
 Examples:
    - When you want to run an action where the target is different from a Node. 
    - When you want to pause / resume the actions.
