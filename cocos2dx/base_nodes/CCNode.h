/** @brief CCNode is the main element. Anything thats gets drawn or contains things that get drawn is a CCNode.
 The most popular CCNodes are: CCScene, CCLayer, CCSprite, CCMenu.

 The main features of a CCNode are:
 - They can contain other CCNode nodes (addChild, getChildByTag, removeChild, etc)
 - They can schedule periodic callback (schedule, unschedule, etc)
 - They can execute actions (runAction, stopAction, etc)

 Some CCNode nodes provide extra functionality for them or their children.

 Subclassing a CCNode usually means (one/all) of:
 - overriding init to initialize resources and schedule callbacks
 - create callbacks to handle the advancement of time
 - overriding draw to render the node

 Features of CCNode:
 - position
 - scale (x, y)
 - rotation (in degrees, clockwise)
 - CCCamera (an interface to gluLookAt )
 - CCGridBase (to do mesh transformations)
 - anchor point
 - size
 - visible
 - z-order
 - openGL z position

 Default values:
 - rotation: 0
 - position: (x=0,y=0)
 - scale: (x=1,y=1)
 - contentSize: (x=0,y=0)
 - anchorPoint: (x=0,y=0)

 Limitations:
 - A CCNode is a "void" object. It doesn't have a texture

 Order in transformations with grid disabled
 -# The node will be translated (position)
 -# The node will be rotated (rotation)
 -# The node will be scaled (scale)
 -# The node will be moved according to the camera values (camera)

 Order in transformations with grid enabled
 -# The node will be translated (position)
 -# The node will be rotated (rotation)
 -# The node will be scaled (scale)
 -# The grid will capture the screen
 -# The node will be moved according to the camera values (camera)
 -# The grid will render the captured screen

 Camera:
 - Each node has a camera. By default it points to the center of the CCNode.
