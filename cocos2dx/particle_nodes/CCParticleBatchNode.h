/** ParticleBatchNode is like a batch node: if it contains children, it will draw them in 1 single OpenGL call
 * (often known as "batch draw").
 *
 * A ParticleBatchNode can reference one and only one texture (one image file, one texture atlas).
 * Only the ParticleSystems that are contained in that texture can be added to the SpriteBatchNode.
 * All ParticleSystems added to a SpriteBatchNode are drawn in one OpenGL ES draw call.
 * If the ParticleSystems are not added to a ParticleBatchNode then an OpenGL ES draw call will be needed for each one, which is less efficient.
 *
 *
 * Limitations:
 * - At the moment only ParticleSystemQuad is supported
 * - All systems need to be drawn with the same parameters, blend function, aliasing, texture
 *
 * Most efficient usage
 * - Initialize the ParticleBatchNode with the texture and enough capacity for all the particle systems
 * - Initialize all particle systems and add them as child to the batch node
 * @since v1.1
