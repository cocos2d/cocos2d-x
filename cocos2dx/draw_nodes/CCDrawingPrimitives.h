/**
 @file
 Drawing OpenGL ES primitives.
 - drawPoint, drawPoints
 - drawLine
 - drawRect, drawSolidRect
 - drawPoly, drawSolidPoly
 - drawCircle
 - drawQuadBezier
 - drawCubicBezier
 - drawCatmullRom
 - drawCardinalSpline
 
 You can change the color, point size, width by calling:
 - drawColor4B(), drawColor4F()
 - ccPointSize()
 - glLineWidth()
 
 @warning These functions draws the Line, Point, Polygon, immediately. They aren't batched. If you are going to make a game that depends on these primitives, I suggest creating a batch. Instead you should use DrawNode
