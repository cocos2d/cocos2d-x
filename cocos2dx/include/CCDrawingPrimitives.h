 Drawing OpenGL ES primitives.
 - ccDrawPoint
 - ccDrawLine
 - ccDrawPoly
 - ccDrawCircle
 - ccDrawQuadBezier
 - ccDrawCubicBezier
 
 You can change the color, width and other property by calling the
 glColor4ub(), glLineWitdh(), glPointSize().
 
 @warning These functions draws the Line, Point, Polygon, immediately. They aren't batched. If you are going to make a game that depends on these primitives, I suggest creating a batch.
