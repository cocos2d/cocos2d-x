	/** @brief CCNode is the main element. Anything thats gets drawn or contains things that get drawn is a CCNode.
     The most popular CCNodes are: CCScene, CCLayer, CCSprite, CCMenu.

     The main features of a CCNode are:
     - They can contain other CCNode nodes (addChild, getChildByTag, removeChild, etc)
     - They can schedule periodic callback (schedule, unschedule, etc)
     - They can execute actions (runAction, stopAction, etc)

     Some CCNode nodes provide extra functionality for them or their children.

     Subclassing a CCNode usually means (one/all) of:
     - overriding init to initialize resources and schedule callbacks
     - create callbacks to handle the advancement of time
     - overriding draw to render the node

     Features of CCNode:
     - position
     - scale (x, y)
     - rotation (in degrees, clockwise)
     - CCCamera (an interface to gluLookAt )
     - CCGridBase (to do mesh transformations)
     - anchor point
     - size
     - visible
     - z-order
     - openGL z position

     Default values:
     - rotation: 0
     - position: (x=0,y=0)
     - scale: (x=1,y=1)
     - contentSize: (x=0,y=0)
     - anchorPoint: (x=0,y=0)

     Limitations:
     - A CCNode is a "void" object. It doesn't have a texture

     Order in transformations with grid disabled
     -# The node will be translated (position)
     -# The node will be rotated (rotation)
     -# The node will be scaled (scale)
     -# The node will be moved according to the camera values (camera)

     Order in transformations with grid enabled
     -# The node will be translated (position)
     -# The node will be rotated (rotation)
     -# The node will be scaled (scale)
     -# The grid will capture the screen
     -# The node will be moved according to the camera values (camera)
     -# The grid will render the captured screen

     Camera:
     - Each node has a camera. By default it points to the center of the CCNode.
