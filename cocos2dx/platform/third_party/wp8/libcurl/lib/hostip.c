/*
 * hostip.c explained
 * ==================
 *
 * The main COMPILE-TIME DEFINES to keep in mind when reading the host*.c
 * source file are these:
 *
 * CURLRES_IPV6 - this host has getaddrinfo() and family, and thus we use
 * that. The host may not be able to resolve IPv6, but we don't really have to
 * take that into account. Hosts that aren't IPv6-enabled have CURLRES_IPV4
 * defined.
 *
 * CURLRES_ARES - is defined if libcurl is built to use c-ares for
 * asynchronous name resolves. This can be Windows or *nix.
 *
 * CURLRES_THREADED - is defined if libcurl is built to run under (native)
 * Windows, and then the name resolve will be done in a new thread, and the
 * supported API will be the same as for ares-builds.
 *
 * If any of the two previous are defined, CURLRES_ASYNCH is defined too. If
 * libcurl is not built to use an asynchronous resolver, CURLRES_SYNCH is
 * defined.
 *
 * The host*.c sources files are split up like this:
 *
 * hostip.c   - method-independent resolver functions and utility functions
 * hostasyn.c - functions for asynchronous name resolves
 * hostsyn.c  - functions for synchronous name resolves
 * hostip4.c  - ipv4-specific functions
 * hostip6.c  - ipv6-specific functions
 *
 * The two asynchronous name resolver backends are implemented in:
 * asyn-ares.c   - functions for ares-using name resolves
 * asyn-thread.c - functions for threaded name resolves

 * The hostip.h is the united header file for all this. It defines the
 * CURLRES_* defines based on the config*.h and curl_setup.h defines.
