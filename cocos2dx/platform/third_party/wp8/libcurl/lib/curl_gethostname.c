/*
 * Curl_gethostname() is a wrapper around gethostname() which allows
 * overriding the host name that the function would normally return.
 * This capability is used by the test suite to verify exact matching
 * of NTLM authentication, which exercises libcurl's MD4 and DES code
 * as well as by the SMTP module when a hostname is not provided.
 *
 * For libcurl debug enabled builds host name overriding takes place
 * when environment variable CURL_GETHOSTNAME is set, using the value
 * held by the variable to override returned host name.
 *
 * Note: The function always returns the un-qualified hostname rather
 * than being provider dependent.
 *
 * For libcurl shared library release builds the test suite preloads
 * another shared library named libhostname using the LD_PRELOAD
 * mechanism which intercepts, and might override, the gethostname()
 * function call. In this case a given platform must support the
 * LD_PRELOAD mechanism and additionally have environment variable
 * CURL_GETHOSTNAME set in order to override the returned host name.
 *
 * For libcurl static library release builds no overriding takes place.
