/** \class SkCanvas

    A Canvas encapsulates all of the state about drawing into a device (bitmap).
    This includes a reference to the device itself, and a stack of matrix/clip
    values. For any given draw call (e.g. drawRect), the geometry of the object
    being drawn is transformed by the concatenation of all the matrices in the
    stack. The transformed geometry is clipped by the intersection of all of
    the clips in the stack.

    While the Canvas holds the state of the drawing device, the state (style)
    of the object being drawn is held by the Paint, which is provided as a
    parameter to each of the draw() methods. The Paint holds attributes such as
    color, typeface, textSize, strokeWidth, shader (e.g. gradients, patterns),
    etc.
