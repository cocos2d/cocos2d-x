    These are our vertex-indices for a series of "quads", which we implement
    as a series of pairs of triangles. See setRectFan() for the
    vertex order.

    The largest value is 255, so we could store these in any size
    (byte, short, int). Since the table is small, we just choose the size
    that we think will be fastest (e.g. some drivers don't have native support
    for byte-indices, so byte may not be the fastest)
