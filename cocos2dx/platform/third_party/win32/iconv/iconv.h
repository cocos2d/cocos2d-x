/* We would like to #include any system header file which could define
   iconv_t, 1. in order to eliminate the risk that the user gets compilation
   errors because some other system header file includes /usr/include/iconv.h
   which defines iconv_t or declares iconv after this file, 2. when compiling
   for LIBICONV_PLUG, we need the proper iconv_t type in order to produce
   binary compatible code.
   But gcc's #include_next is not portable. Thus, once libiconv's iconv.h
   has been installed in /usr/local/include, there is no way any more to
   include the original /usr/include/iconv.h. We simply have to get away
   without it.
   Ad 1. The risk that a system header file does
   #include "iconv.h"  or  #include_next "iconv.h"
   is small. They all do #include <iconv.h>.
   Ad 2. The iconv_t type is a pointer type in all cases I have seen. (It
   has to be a scalar type because (iconv_t)(-1) is a possible return value
   from iconv_open().) */
