/** CCSpriteBatchNode is like a batch node: if it contains children, it will draw them in 1 single OpenGL call
* (often known as "batch draw").
*
* A CCSpriteBatchNode can reference one and only one texture (one image file, one texture atlas).
* Only the CCSprites that are contained in that texture can be added to the CCSpriteBatchNode.
* All CCSprites added to a CCSpriteBatchNode are drawn in one OpenGL ES draw call.
* If the CCSprites are not added to a CCSpriteBatchNode then an OpenGL ES draw call will be needed for each one, which is less efficient.
*
*
* Limitations:
*  - The only object that is accepted as child (or grandchild, grand-grandchild, etc...) is CCSprite or any subclass of CCSprite. eg: particles, labels and layer can't be added to a CCSpriteBatchNode.
*  - Either all its children are Aliased or Antialiased. It can't be a mix. This is because "alias" is a property of the texture, and all the sprites share the same texture.
* 
* @since v0.7.1
