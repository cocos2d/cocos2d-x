/** @brief A class that implements a Texture Atlas.
Supported features:
* The atlas file can be a PVRTC, PNG or any other fomrat supported by Texture2D
* Quads can be udpated in runtime
* Quads can be added in runtime
* Quads can be removed in runtime
* Quads can be re-ordered in runtime
* The TextureAtlas capacity can be increased or decreased in runtime
* OpenGL component: V3F, C4B, T2F.
The quads are rendered using an OpenGL ES VBO.
To render the quads using an interleaved vertex array list, you should modify the ccConfig.h file
