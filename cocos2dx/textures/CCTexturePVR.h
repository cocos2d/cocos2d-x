/** CCTexturePVR
     
 Object that loads PVR images.

 Supported PVR formats:
    - RGBA8888
    - BGRA8888
    - RGBA4444
    - RGBA5551
    - RGB565
    - A8
    - I8
    - AI88
    - PVRTC 4BPP
    - PVRTC 2BPP
     
 Limitations:
    Pre-generated mipmaps, such as PVR textures with mipmap levels embedded in file,
    are only supported if all individual sprites are of _square_ size. 
    To use mipmaps with non-square textures, instead call CCTexture2D#generateMipmap on the sheet texture itself
    (and to save space, save the PVR sprite sheet without mip maps included).
