 *
 * Sweep-and-update Euclidean distance transform of an
 * image. Positive pixels are treated as object pixels,
 * zero or negative pixels are treated as background.
 * An attempt is made to treat antialiased edges correctly.
 * The input image must have pixels in the range [0,1],
 * and the antialiased image should be a box-filter
 * sampling of the ideal, crisp edge.
 * If the antialias region is more than 1 pixel wide,
 * the result from this transform will be inaccurate.
 *
 * By Stefan Gustavson (stefan.gustavson@gmail.com).
 *
 * Originally written in 1994, based on a verbal
 * description of the SSED8 algorithm published in the
 * PhD dissertation of Ingemar Ragnemalm. This is his
 * algorithm, I only implemented it in C.
 *
 * Updated in 2004 to treat border pixels correctly,
 * and cleaned up the code to improve readability.
 *
 * Updated in 2009 to handle anti-aliased edges.
 *
 * Updated in 2011 to avoid a corner case infinite loop.
