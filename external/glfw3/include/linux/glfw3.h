 * The naming of the key codes follow these rules:
 *  - The US keyboard layout is used
 *  - Names of printable alpha-numeric characters are used (e.g. "A", "R",
 *    "3", etc.)
 *  - For non-alphanumeric characters, Unicode:ish names are used (e.g.
 *    "COMMA", "LEFT_SQUARE_BRACKET", etc.). Note that some names do not
 *    correspond to the Unicode standard (usually for brevity)
 *  - Keys that lack a clear US mapping are named "WORLD_x"
 *  - For non-printable keys, custom names are used (e.g. "F4",
 *    "BACKSPACE", etc.)
