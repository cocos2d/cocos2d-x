2011-04-30  Antonio Diaz Diaz  <ant_diaz@teleline.es>

	* Version 1.12 released.
	* main.cc: Added new option `-F, --recompress'.
	* encoder.h (update_prices): Update high length symbol prices
	  independently of the value of `pos_state'. This gives better
	  compression for large values of `--match-length' without being
	  slower.
	* encoder.h encoder.cc: Optimize pair price calculations. This
	  reduces compression time for large values of `--match-length'
	  by up to 6%.
	* Compression time of option `-0' has been reduced by 2%.
	* main.cc (decompress): Print only one status line for each
	  multimember file when only one `-v' is specified.
	* main.cc (decompress): Print up to 6 bytes of trailing garbage
	  when `-vvvv' is specified.
	* main.cc (open_instream): Do not show the message
	  " and `--stdout' was not specified" for directories, etc.
	* lziprecover.cc: If `-v' is not specified show errors only.
	* testsuite/unzcrash.cc: Use Arg_parser.
	* testsuite/unzcrash.cc: Added new options `-b', `-p' and `-s'.

2010-09-16  Antonio Diaz Diaz  <ant_diaz@teleline.es>

	* Version 1.11 released.
	* Added new option `-0' which produces a compression speed and
	  ratio comparable to those of `gzip -9'.
	* fast_encoder.h fast_encoder.cc: New files.
	* main.cc: Match length limit set by options -1 to -8 has been
	  reduced to extend range of use towards gzip. Lower numbers now
	  compress less but faster. (-1 now takes 43% less time for only
	  20% larger compressed size).
	* encoder.cc: Compression of option -9 has been slightly increased.
	* lziprecover.cc: Added new option `--merge' which tries to
	  produce a correct file merging the good parts of two or more
	  damaged copies.
	* lziprecover.cc: Added new option `--repair' for repairing a
	  1-byte error in single-member files.
	* decoder.cc (decode_member): Detect file errors earlier to
	  improve efficiency of lziprecover's new repair capability.
	  This change also prevents (harmless) access to uninitialized
	  memory when decompressing a corrupt file.
	* lziprecover.cc: Added new option `--force'.
	* lziprecover.cc: Added new option `--output'.
	* lziprecover.cc: Added new option `--split' to select the until
	  now only operation of splitting multimember files.
	* lziprecover.cc: If no operation is specified, warn the user
	  and do nothing.
	* main.cc: Fixed warning about fchown's return value being ignored.
	* decoder.cc: `-tvvvv' now also shows compression ratio.
	* main.cc: Set stdin/stdout in binary mode on MSVC and OS2.
	* New examples have been added to the manual.
	* testsuite: `test1' renamed to `test.txt'. Added new tests.
	* Matchfinder types HC4 (4 bytes hash-chain) and HT4 (4 bytes
	  hash-table) have been tested and found no better than the
	  current BT4.

2010-04-05  Antonio Diaz Diaz  <ant_diaz@teleline.es>

	* Version 1.10 released.
	* decoder.h: Input_buffer integrated in Range_decoder.
	* main.cc: File specified with option `-o' is now created with
	  mode 0666 if umask allows it, deleted if interrupted by user.
	* main.cc: New constant `o_binary'.
	* main.cc: Dictionary size for options -2, -3, -4 and -8 has
	  been changed to improve linearity of compressed sizes.
	* lzip.h: Fixed warnings produced by over-optimization (-O3).
	* Makefile.in: Added quotes to directory names.

2010-01-17  Antonio Diaz Diaz  <ant_diaz@teleline.es>

	* Version 1.9 released.
