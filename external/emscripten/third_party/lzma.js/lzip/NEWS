Changes in version 1.12:

The option "-F, --recompress", which forces recompression of files whose
name already has the ".lz" or ".tlz" suffix, has been added.

For large values of "--match-length", compression ratio has been
slightly increased and compression time has been reduced by up to 6%.

Compression time of option "-0" has been reduced by 2%.

Print only one status line for each multimember file when only one "-v"
is specified.

Print up to 6 bytes of trailing garbage when "-vvvv" is specified.

Do not show the message "and `--stdout' was not specified" for file
types that can't be read (directories, etc).

If "--verbose" is not specified, lziprecover now only shows errors and
warnings.

Options "--bits", "--position" and "--size" has been added to unzcrash.
