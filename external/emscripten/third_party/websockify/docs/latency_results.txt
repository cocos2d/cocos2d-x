This data is raw copy from the latency tester set to send a frame with
a little over 2000 KB of data every 10ms.

The number of packets sent and received is just a visual counter and
is just the total when I chose to stop the test (around 3000 or so
packets).

The latency measure are from the point the packet was sent to when it
was received back again in milliseconds. One notable data point
missing from this is how long it actually took for the client to send
3000 packets because sending large packets can put load on the browser
and it may be a lot longer than 10ms before the timer event to
send the next packet fires. So even with low latency numbers, the
actual send rate may be fairly low because sending the WebSockets
frames is impacting the performance of the browser in general.
