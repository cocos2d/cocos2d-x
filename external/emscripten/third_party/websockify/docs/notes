Some implementation notes:

There is an included flash object (web-socket-js) that is used to
emulate websocket support on browsers without websocket support
(currently only Chrome has WebSocket support).

Javascript doesn't have a bytearray type, so what you get out of
a WebSocket object is just Javascript strings.  Javascript has UTF-16
unicode strings and anything sent through the WebSocket gets converted
to UTF-8 and vice-versa. So, one additional (and necessary) function
of wsproxy is base64 encoding/decoding what is sent to/from the
browser.

Building web-socket-js emulator:

cd include/web-socket-js/flash-src
mxmlc -static-link-runtime-shared-libraries WebSocketMain.as
