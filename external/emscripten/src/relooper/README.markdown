Relooper
========

This is an optimized C++ implemention of the Relooper algorithm originally
developed as part of Emscripten. This implementation includes optimizations
added since the original academic paper [1] - see paper.pdf - was published
about it, and is written in an LLVM-friendly way with the goal of inclusion
in upstream LLVM.
