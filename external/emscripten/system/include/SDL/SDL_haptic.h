 *  \file SDL_haptic.h
 *  
 *  \brief The SDL Haptic subsystem allows you to control haptic (force feedback)
 *         devices.
 * 
 *  The basic usage is as follows:
 *   - Initialize the Subsystem (::SDL_INIT_HAPTIC).
 *   - Open a Haptic Device.
 *    - SDL_HapticOpen() to open from index.
 *    - SDL_HapticOpenFromJoystick() to open from an existing joystick.
 *   - Create an effect (::SDL_HapticEffect).
 *   - Upload the effect with SDL_HapticNewEffect().
 *   - Run the effect with SDL_HapticRunEffect().
 *   - (optional) Free the effect with SDL_HapticDestroyEffect().
 *   - Close the haptic device with SDL_HapticClose().
 *
 * \par Simple rumble example:
 * \code
 *    SDL_Haptic *haptic;
 *
 *    // Open the device
 *    haptic = SDL_HapticOpen( 0 );
 *    if (haptic == NULL)
 *       return -1;
 *
 *    // Initialize simple rumble
 *    if (SDL_HapticRumbleInit( haptic ) != 0)
 *       return -1;
 *
 *    // Play effect at 50% strength for 2 seconds
 *    if (SDL_HapticRumblePlay( haptic, 0.5, 2000 ) != 0)
 *       return -1;
 *    SDL_Delay( 2000 );
 *
 *    // Clean up
 *    SDL_HapticClose( haptic );
 * \endcode
 *
 * \par Complete example:
 * \code
 * int test_haptic( SDL_Joystick * joystick ) {
 *    SDL_Haptic *haptic;
 *    SDL_HapticEffect effect;
 *    int effect_id;
 *
 *    // Open the device
 *    haptic = SDL_HapticOpenFromJoystick( joystick );
 *    if (haptic == NULL) return -1; // Most likely joystick isn't haptic
 *
 *    // See if it can do sine waves
 *    if ((SDL_HapticQuery(haptic) & SDL_HAPTIC_SINE)==0) {
 *       SDL_HapticClose(haptic); // No sine effect
 *       return -1;
 *    }
 *
 *    // Create the effect
 *    memset( &effect, 0, sizeof(SDL_HapticEffect) ); // 0 is safe default
 *    effect.type = SDL_HAPTIC_SINE;
 *    effect.periodic.direction.type = SDL_HAPTIC_POLAR; // Polar coordinates
 *    effect.periodic.direction.dir[0] = 18000; // Force comes from south
 *    effect.periodic.period = 1000; // 1000 ms
 *    effect.periodic.magnitude = 20000; // 20000/32767 strength
 *    effect.periodic.length = 5000; // 5 seconds long
 *    effect.periodic.attack_length = 1000; // Takes 1 second to get max strength
 *    effect.periodic.fade_length = 1000; // Takes 1 second to fade away
 *
 *    // Upload the effect
 *    effect_id = SDL_HapticNewEffect( haptic, &effect );
 *
 *    // Test the effect
 *    SDL_HapticRunEffect( haptic, effect_id, 1 );
 *    SDL_Delay( 5000); // Wait for the effect to finish
 *
 *    // We destroy the effect, although closing the device also does this
 *    SDL_HapticDestroyEffect( haptic, effect_id );
 *
 *    // Close the device
 *    SDL_HapticClose(haptic);
 *
 *    return 0; // Success
 * }
 * \endcode

 *  
 *  If type is ::SDL_HAPTIC_POLAR, direction is encoded by hundredths of a 
 *  degree starting north and turning clockwise.  ::SDL_HAPTIC_POLAR only uses
 *  the first \c dir parameter.  The cardinal directions would be:
 *   - North: 0 (0 degrees)
 *   - East: 9000 (90 degrees)
 *   - South: 18000 (180 degrees)
 *   - West: 27000 (270 degrees)
 *  
 *  If type is ::SDL_HAPTIC_CARTESIAN, direction is encoded by three positions
 *  (X axis, Y axis and Z axis (with 3 axes)).  ::SDL_HAPTIC_CARTESIAN uses
 *  the first three \c dir parameters.  The cardinal directions would be:
 *   - North:  0,-1, 0
 *   - East:  -1, 0, 0
 *   - South:  0, 1, 0
 *   - West:   1, 0, 0
 *  
 *  The Z axis represents the height of the effect if supported, otherwise
 *  it's unused.  In cartesian encoding (1, 2) would be the same as (2, 4), you
 *  can use any multiple you want, only the direction matters.
 *  
 *  If type is ::SDL_HAPTIC_SPHERICAL, direction is encoded by two rotations.
 *  The first two \c dir parameters are used.  The \c dir parameters are as 
 *  follows (all values are in hundredths of degrees):
 *   - Degrees from (1, 0) rotated towards (0, 1).
 *   - Degrees towards (0, 0, 1) (device needs at least 3 axes).
 *
 *
 *  Example of force coming from the south with all encodings (force coming
 *  from the south means the user will have to pull the stick to counteract):
 *  \code
 *  SDL_HapticDirection direction;
 *  
 *  // Cartesian directions
 *  direction.type = SDL_HAPTIC_CARTESIAN; // Using cartesian direction encoding.
 *  direction.dir[0] = 0; // X position
 *  direction.dir[1] = 1; // Y position
 *  // Assuming the device has 2 axes, we don't need to specify third parameter.
 *  
 *  // Polar directions
 *  direction.type = SDL_HAPTIC_POLAR; // We'll be using polar direction encoding.
 *  direction.dir[0] = 18000; // Polar only uses first parameter
 *  
 *  // Spherical coordinates
 *  direction.type = SDL_HAPTIC_SPHERICAL; // Spherical encoding
 *  direction.dir[0] = 9000; // Since we only have two axes we don't need more parameters.

 *  
 *  A periodic effect consists in a wave-shaped effect that repeats itself
 *  over time.  The type determines the shape of the wave and the parameters
 *  determine the dimensions of the wave.
 *  
 *  Phase is given by hundredth of a cyle meaning that giving the phase a value
 *  of 9000 will displace it 25% of it's period.  Here are sample values:
 *   -     0: No phase displacement.
 *   -  9000: Displaced 25% of it's period.
 *   - 18000: Displaced 50% of it's period.
 *   - 27000: Displaced 75% of it's period.
 *   - 36000: Displaced 100% of it's period, same as 0, but 0 is preffered.

 *  \brief The generic template for any haptic effect.
 *  
 *  All values max at 32767 (0x7FFF).  Signed values also can be negative.
 *  Time values unless specified otherwise are in milliseconds.
 *  
 *  You can also pass ::SDL_HAPTIC_INFINITY to length instead of a 0-32767 
 *  value.  Neither delay, interval, attack_length nor fade_length support 
 *  ::SDL_HAPTIC_INFINITY.  Fade will also not be used since effect never ends.
 *  
 *  Additionally, the ::SDL_HAPTIC_RAMP effect does not support a duration of
 *  ::SDL_HAPTIC_INFINITY.
 *  
 *  Button triggers may not be supported on all devices, it is advised to not
 *  use them if possible.  Buttons start at index 1 instead of index 0 like
 *  they joystick.
 *  
 *  If both attack_length and fade_level are 0, the envelope is not used,
 *  otherwise both values are used.
 *  
 *  Common parts:
 *  \code
 *  // Replay - All effects have this
 *  Uint32 length;        // Duration of effect (ms).
 *  Uint16 delay;         // Delay before starting effect.
 *  
 *  // Trigger - All effects have this
 *  Uint16 button;        // Button that triggers effect.
 *  Uint16 interval;      // How soon before effect can be triggered again.
 *  
 *  // Envelope - All effects except condition effects have this
 *  Uint16 attack_length; // Duration of the attack (ms).
 *  Uint16 attack_level;  // Level at the start of the attack.
 *  Uint16 fade_length;   // Duration of the fade out (ms).
 *  Uint16 fade_level;    // Level at the end of the fade.
 *  \endcode
