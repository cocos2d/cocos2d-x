 *    - \c desired->freq should be the desired audio frequency in samples-per-
 *      second.
 *    - \c desired->format should be the desired audio format.

 *      samples.  This number should be a power of two, and may be adjusted by 
 *      the audio driver to a value more suitable for the hardware.  Good values
 *      seem to range between 512 and 8096 inclusive, depending on the 
 *      application and CPU speed.  Smaller values yield faster response time, 
 *      but can lead to underflow if the application is doing heavy processing 
 *      and cannot fill the audio buffer in time.  A stereo sample consists of 
 *      both right and left channels in LR ordering.
 *      Note that the number of samples is directly related to time by the
 *      following formula:  \code ms = (samples*1000)/freq \endcode
 *    - \c desired->size is the size in bytes of the audio buffer, and is
 *      calculated by SDL_OpenAudio().
 *    - \c desired->silence is the value used to set the buffer to silence,
 *      and is calculated by SDL_OpenAudio().
 *    - \c desired->callback should be set to a function that will be called
 *      when the audio device is ready for more data.  It is passed a pointer
 *      to the audio buffer, and the length in bytes of the audio buffer.
 *      This function usually runs in a separate thread, and so you should
 *      protect data structures that it accesses by calling SDL_LockAudio()
 *      and SDL_UnlockAudio() in your code.
 *    - \c desired->userdata is passed as the first parameter to your callback
 *      function.
 *  
 *  The audio device starts out playing silence when it's opened, and should
 *  be enabled for playing by calling \c SDL_PauseAudio(0) when you are ready
