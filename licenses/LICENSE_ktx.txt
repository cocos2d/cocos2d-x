The library and tools are open source software. Most of the code is licensed
under a modified BSD license. The code for unpacking ETC1, ETC2 and EAC
compressed textures has a separate license that restricts it to uses
associated with Khronos Group APIs. See [Licensing](http://www.khronos.org/opengles/sdk/tools/KTX/doc/libktx/licensing.html)
for more details.
