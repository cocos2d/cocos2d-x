* Added `ClippingRectangNode`, it is more effecient for renctangle clipping
* Node: schedule/unschedule lambda functions
* Facebook platform support in plugin-x, all features has been added, but the API needs to be polished with Facebook guys

# Features in detail

## Light

To make 3d objects looks realistic, we add lights to this version. cocos2d-x supports four types of lights, directional light, point light, spot light and ambient light.

`DirectionLight` is meant to represent an extremely distant light source (like the sun or moon). Rays cast from directional lights run parallel in a single direction from every point in the sky, and are typically used to simulate the sun light.

The following code can add a directional light to the scene,

```c++
auto directionalLight = DirectionLight::create(Vec3(-1.0f, -1.0f, 0.0f), Color3B(200, 200, 200));
addChild(directionalLight);
```

The light is enabled by default. And it can be disabled using the following code,

```c++
directionalLight->setEnabled(false);
```

You can also set a light flag to the light.

```c++
directionalLight->setLightFlag(LightFlag::LIGHT0);
```

Then the 3d sprite whose light mask AND light flag is none zero can effect by the light.

`PointLight` casts illumination outward in every direction from a single, infinitely small point in 3D space. It is useful for simulating any omnidirectional light source.

`SpotLight` emits a cone shaped light field from a single point in space. It can be used to simulate desk lamps, overhead cone lighting, etc. Note that `SpotLight` will take more GPU time.

`AmbientLight` casts soft rays in every direction.

Note that we use forward render method, the number of lights can effect the performance. You can set the max number of lights supported in the shader in a the configuration file.

```c++
<key>cocos2d.x.3d.max_dir_light_in_shader</key>
<integer>1</integer>
<key>cocos2d.x.3d.max_point_light_in_shader</key>
<integer>1</integer>
<key>cocos2d.x.3d.max_spot_light_in_shader</key>
<integer>1</integer>
```

## Spine runtime

Spine runtime is updated to latest version `v2.0.18`. This version supports `Free-Form-Deformation(FFD)`, which allows meshes to stretch, squash, blend and bounce in ways that aren't possible using rectangle images.

`Spine rutnime has updated its license which only allows engine to use unmodified version even it has bugs. So you guys don't send pull requests for spine runtime, we can not merge them.`

Please refer to `tests/cpp-tests/Classes/SpineTest/SpineTest.cpp` for usage.

## AssetsManagerEx

`AssetsMangerEx` is an enhancement version of `AssetsManager`. Compared to `AssetsManager`, there are some pros using `AssetsManagerEx`:

* complex update package support with manifest file
* multi-thread downloading support
* continue transferring from breakpoint

Please refer to [this document](http://cocos2d-x.org/wiki/Assets_manager) for detail information.

## Application::openURL

Because in iOS, there is an function named `openURL` in `UIApplication`, so we added this function in Application too. You can use this function to open a url.

```c++
Application::getInstance()->openURL("http://www.cocos2d-x.org/");
```

## ClippingRectangleNode

`ClippingRectangleNode` is a lite version of `ClippingNode`. Compared to `ClippingNode`, there re some pros and cons:

* pros
    * it doesn't depend on stencil buffer, which means it can run on more Android devices
    * it is more efficient
    
* cons
    * it can only used to clip rectangle area
    
```c++
auto clipper = ClippingRectangleNode::create();
clipper->setClippingRegion(0, 0, 200, 200);
this->addChild(clipper);

auto content = Sprite::create("MyPicture.png");
...
clipper->addChild(content);
```

## Facebook integration

TBD

# Highlights of v3.3beta0

* 3d: `BillBoard`
* audio: new audio is added on iOS and Android
* DrawNode: added as many functions as `DrawPrimitive`, and `DrawPrimitive` is deprecated
* Renderer: added `trianle command`
* UI: added `WebView` on iOS and Android
* Many other small features added and many bugs fixed

# Features in detail

## BillBoard

`BillBoard` is a rectangle always faces to the camera. It is useful in the 3D world. People use BillBoard to create trees in some racing games. It looks real, but the cost is much lower than 3d tree.

`BillBoard` inherits from Sprite, so it also supports animate. Here is example of creating BillBoard.

```c++
//create billboard from .png
auto billboard = BillBoard::create("Images/Icon.png");
addChild(billboard);

//create camera that is looking at this billboard. Otherwise, it is seen by the default camera
auto camera = Camera::createPerspective(60, (GLfloat)s.width/s.height, 1, 1000);
camera->setCameraFlag(CameraFlag::CAMERA_USER1);
addChild(camera); //add this camera

//This billboard is only seen by the camera with flag CameraFlag::CAMERA_USER1.
billboard->setCameraMask((unsigned short)CameraFlag::CAMERA_USER1);
```

## Triangles command

We have enhanced auto batching feature by introduce `TrianglesCommand`, the rendering of the `Triangles` can be auto batched. Now if we have anything which can be rendered by `Triangles`, we can use `TrianglesCommand` or inherit from `TrianglesCommand` to take use of auto batching feature and gain rendering improvements. The `QuadCommand`, which is used for `Quad` rendering, is a good example of inheriting from `TrianglesCommand`.

The step to use Triangle Command is very simple.

```
	Triangles trs{verts, indices, vertCount, indexCount};
	command->init(globalZOrder,textureID, glProgramState,blend,trs,matrix);
	renderer->addCommand(command);
```
To improve performance, `Triangles` will hold a weak reference to the vertices and indices data to be rendered, which is the same like `QuadCommand`. The userer should not release any rendered data before the `Command` is executed by `Renderer`.

## WebView
WebView is an new widget type which allows you to display web content inside Cocos2D-X. We only provide iOS and Android implementation currently, more platform might be added in the future.

The class is under `cocos2d::ui::experimental` namespace.

As we clarified the `experimental` namespace before, the `experimental` namespace doesn't mean the widget is incomplete, but only due to the lack of full platform support. Feel free to use the WebView
widget in your game.

To display the website Google in a WebView, we could simply write:

```cpp
    _webView = cocos2d::experimental::ui::WebView::create();
    _webView->setPosition(winSize/2);
    _webView->setContentSize(winSize * 0.5);
    _webView->loadUrl("http://www.google.com");
    _webView->setScalesPageToFit(true);
```

The `setscalesPageToFit` method will adjust the WebView content to fit the content size you set.

We could also set some callback to the WebView:

```cpp
    //we should check the validation of the URL and decide whether to continue or not
    _webView->shouldStartLoading = CC_CALLBACK_2(WebViewTest::onWebViewShouldStartLoading, this);
    //called when web page is finish loading
    _webView->didFinishLoading = CC_CALLBACK_2(WebViewTest::onWebViewDidFinishLoading, this);
    //called when web page is fail loading
    _webView->didFailLoading = CC_CALLBACK_2(WebViewTest::onWebViewDidFailLoading, this);
```

For full test case, please refer to [WebViewTest](https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/blob/v3/tests/cpp-tests/Classes/UITest/CocoStudioGUITest/UIWebViewTest/UIWebViewTest.cpp)


## New audio

New audio is more powerful than old one, and it is not compatible with old one. We will deprecated old one when new audio is ready on all supported platforms. Now it only supports iOS and Android. We plan to finish it on v3.4.

What's enhanced in new audio engine:

* can play more than one backgournd music
* can have a call back when an audio(music or effect) finishs
* can get duration of an audio
* can get/set playback position of a playing audio
* can change loop state when playing

The difference compared to old audio engine

* all functions are static, which means you can more easy to invoke function, such as `Audio::play2d()`
* there is only one method `play2d()` to play music or effect
* should use `Audio::getState()` to determine an audio is playing, paused
* its class name is `cocos2d::experimental::AudioEngine` in c++, and its module name is `ccexp.AudioEngine` in lua-binding
* there is not preload function, you can play an audio immediately

Full test case please refer to `tests/cpp-tests/Classes/NewAudioEngineTest/NewAudioEngineTest.cpp`.


# Highlights of v3.3alpha0

* 3d: `Camera`, 'Reskin', 'Attachment', 'Better support for FBX', 'New fbx-conv', `AABB`, `OBB` and `Ray`
* ui: added `Scale9Sprite`
* FileUitls: added `isDirectoryExist()`, `createDirectory()`, `removeDirectory()`, `removeFile()`, `renameFile()` and `getFileSize()`
* Device: added `setKeepScreenOn()` on iOS and Android 
* Added c++11 random support
* RenderTexture: added a call back function for `saveToFile()`
* Primitive: Support Points, Lines and Triagles for rendering
* SpriteFrameCache: support loading from plist file content data
* Added a consistent way to set GL context attributes for all platforms
* Only two libraries in cocos2d-x, one for c++ codes, another one for lua-binding codes
* Many other small features added and many bugs fixed

# Features in detail

## Camera

This version of camera is powerful than previous one. And you can add it as a child anywhere. If you want to let a Node to be visited by a camera, Node's camera mask should include Camera's flag:

```c++
// let sprite to be visited by a camera
auto sprite = Sprite::create("myFile.png");
sprite->setCameraMask(CameraFlag::USER1);
auto camera = Camera::createPerspective(60, winSize.width/winSize.height, 1, 1000);
camera->setCameraFlag(CameraFlag::USER1);
scene->addChild(camera);
```

If you have many Nodes that want to be visited by a camera, there is a convenient way:

```c++
auto layer = Layer::create();
auto sprite1 = Sprite::create();
auto sprite2 = Sprite::create();
layer->addChild(sprite1);
layer->addChild(sprite2);
// it will set camera mask for all its children
layer->setCameraMask(CameraFlg::USER1); 

auto camera = Camera::createPerspective();
camera->setCameraFlag(CameraFlag::USER1);
scene->addChild(camera);
```

Full test case please  refer to `tests/cpp-tests/res/Camera3DTest/Camera3DTest.cpp`.

## Reskin

It is a powerful feature, all the user change the appearance of character.

For example, there a model named girl.c3b, which has two coats, coat0 and coat1. 
The character's coat can be changed like this,

```c++
//load the girl from file
auto sprite3d = Sprite3D::create("girl.c3b");
//get the mesh named coat0
auto mesh0 = sprite3d->getMeshByName("coat0");
//you can change texture of this mesh if you like
mesh0->setTexture("cloth.png");
//you can change visibility for this mesh, too
mesh0->setVisible(true);
//hide coat1
auto mesh1 = sprite3d->getMeshByName("coat1");
mesh1->setVisible(false);
```

Full test case please refer to 'tests/cpp-tests/Classes/Spret3DTest/Sprite3DTest.cpp'

## Attachment

Allows to attach a node to a bone

Usage,

```c++
auto sprite = Sprite3D::create("girl.c3b");
auto weapon = Sprite::create("weapon.c3b");
auto attachNode = sprite->getAttachNode("left_hand");
attachNode->addChild(weapon);
```

Full test case please refer to 'tests/cpp-tests/Classes/Spret3DTest/Sprite3DTest.cpp'

## Better support for FBX

support multiple mesh
support multiple material
bones bind to each mesh limited to 40. But the FBX model can contain more meshes. So the model can contain much more bones.

## New fbx-conv

It can export more complex model, which contains multiple meshes and multiple materials.

## AABB, OBB and Ray

AABB means Axis Aligned Bounding Box
OBB means Oriented Bounding Box
Ray has a origin position and direction

Each Sprite3D or Mesh has its own AABB.
AABB and OBB can be picked by Ray.

Usage,

```c++
//get ray from camera
Vec3 nearP(location.x, location.y, -1.0f), farP(location.x, location.y, 1.0f); 
auto size = Director::getInstance()->getWinSize();
camera->unproject(size, &nearP, &nearP);
camera->unproject(size, &farP, &farP);
ray._origin = nearP;
ray._direction = farP - nearP;
ray.intersects(sprite3d->getAABB( ) );
```

Full test case please refer to 'tests/cpp-tests/Classes/Spret3DTest/Sprite3DTest.cpp'

## ui::Scale9Sprite

Now we have implemented a new Scale9Sprite class under ui module. Its internal implementation is concise than the previous one plus more features.
The main reason of reimplementing this class is that the Scale9Sprite is heavily used in ui module. Now the ui module is not dependent from extension module.
By applying the new ui::Scale9Sprite, the code inside many widget classes are more cleaner and elegant.

We could manually toggle "slice 9" feature by one function call:

```c++
//ui::Scale9Sprite is slice 9 enabled on default
auto sprite = ui::Scale9Sprite::create("foo.png");
sprite->setScale9Enabled(false);
```

It also supports Flipping now.

```c++
auto sprite = ui::Scale9Sprite::create("bar.png");
sprite->setFlippedX(true);
sprite->setFlippedY(false);
```

Since the ui::Scale9Sprite is a Node rather than a Sprite, so you can't add it to a batch node. If you do want to do some actions on the internal sprite, 
you could call `sprite->getSprite()` to access it. 

Full test case please refer to `tests/cpp-tests/Classes/UITests/CocostudioGUITest/UIScale9SpriteTest.cpp`.

## c++11 random support

Since `rand()` is not good(refer to [this document](http://c-faq.com/lib/randrange.html)), we use c++11 random library to do generate random number, and provide a function to easily using:

```c++
int randInt = cocos2d::random(1, 10);
float randFloat = cocos2d::random(1.f, 10.f);
```

## RenderTexture save function

`RenderTexture::saveToFile()` will not save rendertexture when the function returns, because it just send render command to renderer. The file will be saved after render command is executed. It is not convenient if you want to use the saved file to do some work. So we added a parameter in `RenderTexture::saveToFile()` to set a call back function when the file is saved.

```c++
renderTexture->begin();
...
renderTexture->end();

renderTexture->saveToFile("myFile.png", true, callback);

```

## Primitive

`Primitive` is added to support `Points`,`Lines`,`Triangles` rendering. Previously, if we want to draw a custom geometry(sphere, line), we can only do this by using `CustomCommand`. Now, what is need is to create a Primitive, set datas, and use the corresponding `PrimitiveCommand` to draw the Primitive. 

Here is a simple example of rendering a quad in `Sprite`.

1. create verexBuffer

	```c++
	auto vertexBuffer = VerexBuffer::create(sizeof(V3F_C4B_T2F), 4);
	vertexBuffer->updateVertices(&_quad, 4, 0);
	```

2. create vertexData

	```c++
	auto vertexData = VertexData::create();
	vertexData->addStream(vertexBuffer, VertexStreamAttribute(0, VERTEX_ATTRIB_POSITION, GL_FLOAT, 3, fasle));
	vertexData->addStream(vertexBuffer, VertexStreamAttribute(12, VERTEX_ATTRIB_COLOR, GL_UNSIGNED_BTYE, 4, true));
	vertexData->addStream(vertexBuffer, VertexStreamAttribute(16, VERTEX_ATTRIB_TEX_COORD, GL_FLOAT, 2, fasle));
	```
3. create IndexBuffer
	
	```c++
	auto indexBuffer = IndexBuffer::create(IndexType::INDEX_TYPE_SHORT_16, 6);
	short indices[6] = {0,1,2,3,2,1};
	indexBuffer->updateIndices(indices,6, 0);
	```
4. create primitive
	
	```c++
	auto primitve = Primitive::create(vertexData, indexBuffer, GL_TRIANGLES);
	primitive->setStart(0);
	primitive->setCount(6);
	```
5. add command to renderer
	
	```c++
	_command->init(globalZorder,textureID, glprogramState, blend, primitve, modelViewMatrix);
	renderer->addCommand(&_command);
	```

Primitive supports three typs of primitives (POINTS, LINES, TRIANGLES), vertex and index sharing, multiple streams. It has some constrains:

1. The size of vertex and index Buffer is fixed, which means data must be pre allocated.
2. Batching is not supported.

## Consistent way to set GL context attributes

Now you can set GL context attributes by override `Application::initGLContextAttrs()`, then set GL context attributes there.

```c++
void AppDelegate::initGLContextAttrs()
{
    // r:8 g:8 a:8 depth:24 stencil:8
    GLContextAttrs glContextAttrs = {8, 8, 8, 8, 24, 8};
    GLView::setGLContextAttrs(glContextAttrs);
}
```

Now can only support setting bits of `r`, `g`, `b`, `a`, `depth buffer` and `stencil buffer`. We will support other attributes if needed.

## Only two libraries left

Now there are two libraries left: one for all c++ codes and another one for lua-bindings codes. 

If you are developing with c++, you only have to link to `libcocos2d`. `libcocos2d` includes all c++ codes:

* cocos2d(including 2d and 3d)
* network
* cocosstudio
* ui
* cocosbuilder
* spine
* chipmunk
* box2d
* ...

Not used codes will be stripped by linker.

If you are developing with lua, you should link to `libcocos2d` and `libluacocos2d`. You can comment codes in `lua_module_register.h` if you don't want to some module.

```c++
int lua_module_register(lua_State* L)
{
    register_cocosdenshion_module(L); // comment this line to remove cocosdenshion
    register_network_module(L);       // comment this line to remove network
    register_cocosbuilder_module(L);  // comment this line to remove cocosbuilder
    register_cocostudio_module(L);    // comment this line to remove cocostudio
    register_extension_module(L);     // comment this line to remove extension
    register_ui_moudle(L);            // comment this line to remove ui
    register_spine_module(L);         // comment this line to remove spine
    register_cocos3d_module(L);       // comment this line to remove 3d
    return 1;
}
```
