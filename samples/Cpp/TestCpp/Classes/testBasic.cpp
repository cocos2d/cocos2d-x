            ******    GCC Compiler issue on Android and Linux (CLANG compiler is ok)   ******
        We couldn't use 'Scene::create' directly since gcc will trigger
        an error called "error: 'this' was not captured for this lambda function".
        This is because 'Scene' is the super class of TestScene, if we invoke 'Scene::create'
        directly in this lambda expression, gcc compiler found 'Scene::create' and it think
        that was the member function of 'TestScene' 's super class, but this lambda function doesn't
        capture anything like 'this', so it has no access to invoke 'Scene::create'.
         
        Solution (1): Passing 'this' to this lambda function.
        Solution (2): Don't use 'Scene::create' and don't pass 'this' to this lambda function,
                      instead, we just need to new the 'Scene' and initialize the Scene.
         
        Semantically, I think in this lambda function, we shouldn't capture any varibles
                      outside the scope. So I choose the (2) solution. Commented by James Chen.
