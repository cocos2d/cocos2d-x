[cocos2d-x][1] is a multi-platform framework for building 2d games, interactive books, demos and other graphical applications.
It is based on __cocos2d-iphone__, but instead of using Objective-C, it uses C++.
It works on iOS, Android, macOS, Windows and Linux.

Build Requirements
------------------

* Mac OS X 10.7+, Xcode 8+
* or Ubuntu 14.04+, CMake 3.1+
* or Windows 7+, VS 2015
* Python 2.7.5+(NOT Python 3)
* NDK r16+ is required to build Android games
* Android Studio 3.0.0+ to build Android games(tested with 3.0.0)
* JRE or JDK 1.6+ is required for web publishing

Runtime Requirements
--------------------
  * iOS 8.0+ for iPhone / iPad games
  * Android 3.0.0+ for Android
  * OS X v10.9+ for Mac games
  * Windows 7+ for Win games

Environment Setup
--------------------

Should set up environment before starting a new game or running tests

```
$ cd cocos2d-x
$ ./setup.py
$ source FILE_TO_SAVE_SYSTEM_VARIABLE

```

Should invoke this script if using linux system

```
$ cd cocos2d-x
$ ./install-linux-deps.sh
```

Running Tests
--------------------

```
$ cd cocos2d-x
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cocos run --proj-dir .. -p [mac|win32|android|linux|ios]
```

How to start a new game
-----------------------

    $ cd cocos2d-x
    $ ./setup.py
    $ source FILE_TO_SAVE_SYSTEM_VARIABLE
    $ cocos new MyGame -p com.your_company.mygame -l cpp -d NEW_PROJECTS_DIR
    $ cd NEW_PROJECTS_DIR/MyGame
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cocos run --proj-dir .. -p [mac|win32|android|linux|ios]

You can also create a Lua project with `-l lua`.

Using IDE
----------------------------

If need to debug program, then it is more convinent to use IDE to run and debug it. All platforms other than Android can use CMake to generate corresponding project file. Can refer to [Detail CMake Guide](cmake/README.md) for detail information.

For Android, the Android Studio project file lies in `PROJECT_DIR/proj.android`. Can just use Android Studio to import the exsting project file.

Want an awesome editor?
--------------------------------
[Cocos Creator][12] is the new generation of Cocos game engine with a full featured editor and content creation friendly workflow. It supports all major platforms allowing games to be quickly released for the web, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac, and various mini-game platforms. A pure JavaScript-developed engine runtime is available on the web and mini-game platforms for better performance and smaller packages. On other native platforms, C++ is used to implement the underlying framework, providing greater operational efficiency. The engine is completely [open source][13], and retains the advantages of Cocos2d-x which includes high performance, customizability, ease for debugging, easy to learn, and small package size.
