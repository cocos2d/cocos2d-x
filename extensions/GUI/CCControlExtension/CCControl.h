 * @class
 * CCControl is inspired by the UIControl API class from the UIKit library of

 *
 * The goal of CCControl is to define an interface and base implementation for 
 * preparing action messages and initially dispatching them to their targets when
 * certain events occur.
 *
 * To use the CCControl you have to subclass it.
