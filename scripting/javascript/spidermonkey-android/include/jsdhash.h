 * Table entry header structure.
 *
 * In order to allow in-line allocation of key and value, we do not declare

 * The key need not be stored in the entry; it may be part of the value, but
 * need not be stored at all.
 *
 * Callback types are defined below and grouped into the JSDHashTableOps
 * structure, for single static initialization per hash table sub-type.
 *
 * Each hash table sub-type should nest the JSDHashEntryHdr structure at the
 * front of its particular entry type.  The keyHash member contains the result
 * of multiplying the hash code returned from the hashKey callback (see below)
 * by JS_DHASH_GOLDEN_RATIO, then constraining the result to avoid the magic 0
 * and 1 values.  The stored keyHash value is table size invariant, and it is
 * maintained automatically by JS_DHashTableOperate -- users should never set
 * it, and its only uses should be via the entry macros below.
 *
 * The JS_DHASH_ENTRY_IS_LIVE macro tests whether entry is neither free nor
 * removed.  An entry may be either busy or free; if busy, it may be live or
 * removed.  Consumers of this API should not access members of entries that
 * are not live.
 *
 * However, use JS_DHASH_ENTRY_IS_BUSY for faster liveness testing of entries
 * returned by JS_DHashTableOperate, as JS_DHashTableOperate never returns a
 * non-live, busy (i.e., removed) entry pointer to its caller.  See below for
 * more details on JS_DHashTableOperate's calling rules.

/*
 * A JSDHashTable is currently 8 words (without the JS_DHASHMETER overhead)
 * on most architectures, and may be allocated on the stack or within another
 * structure or class (see below for the Init and Finish functions to use).
 *
 * To decide whether to use double hashing vs. chaining, we need to develop a
 * trade-off relation, as follows:
 *
 * Let alpha be the load factor, esize the entry size in words, count the
 * entry count, and pow2 the power-of-two table size in entries.
 *
 *   (JSDHashTable overhead)    > (JSHashTable overhead)
 *   (unused table entry space) > (malloc and .next overhead per entry) +
 *                                (buckets overhead)
 *   (1 - alpha) * esize * pow2 > 2 * count + pow2
 *
 * Notice that alpha is by definition (count / pow2):
 *
 *   (1 - alpha) * esize * pow2 > 2 * alpha * pow2 + pow2
 *   (1 - alpha) * esize        > 2 * alpha + 1
 *
 *   esize > (1 + 2 * alpha) / (1 - alpha)
 *
 * This assumes both tables must keep keyHash, key, and value for each entry,
 * where key and value point to separately allocated strings or structures.
 * If key and value can be combined into one pointer, then the trade-off is:
 *
 *   esize > (1 + 3 * alpha) / (1 - alpha)
 *
 * If the entry value can be a subtype of JSDHashEntryHdr, rather than a type
 * that must be allocated separately and referenced by an entry.value pointer
 * member, and provided key's allocation can be fused with its entry's, then
 * k (the words wasted per entry with chaining) is 4.
 *
 * To see these curves, feed gnuplot input like so:
 *
 *   gnuplot> f(x,k) = (1 + k * x) / (1 - x)
 *   gnuplot> plot [0:.75] f(x,2), f(x,3), f(x,4)
 *
 * For k of 2 and a well-loaded table (alpha > .5), esize must be more than 4
 * words for chaining to be more space-efficient than double hashing.
 *
 * Solving for alpha helps us decide when to shrink an underloaded table:
 *
 *   esize                     > (1 + k * alpha) / (1 - alpha)
 *   esize - alpha * esize     > 1 + k * alpha
 *   esize - 1                 > (k + esize) * alpha
 *   (esize - 1) / (k + esize) > alpha
 *
 *   alpha < (esize - 1) / (esize + k)
 *
 * Therefore double hashing should keep alpha >= (esize - 1) / (esize + k),
 * assuming esize is not too large (in which case, chaining should probably be
 * used for any alpha).  For esize=2 and k=3, we want alpha >= .2; for esize=3
 * and k=2, we want alpha >= .4.  For k=4, esize could be 6, and alpha >= .5
 * would still obtain.  See the JS_DHASH_MIN_ALPHA macro further below.
 *
 * The current implementation uses a configurable lower bound on alpha, which
 * defaults to .25, when deciding to shrink the table (while still respecting
 * JS_DHASH_MIN_SIZE).
 *
 * Note a qualitative difference between chaining and double hashing: under
 * chaining, entry addresses are stable across table shrinks and grows.  With
 * double hashing, you can't safely hold an entry pointer and use it after an
 * ADD or REMOVE operation, unless you sample table->generation before adding
 * or removing, and compare the sample after, dereferencing the entry pointer
 * only if table->generation has not changed.
 *
 * The moral of this story: there is no one-size-fits-all hash table scheme,
 * but for small table entry size, and assuming entry address stability is not
 * required, double hashing wins.

 * "stable" Enumerate doesn't use the set-aside pointers after any call either
 * to PL_DHashTableOperate, or to an "unstable" form of Enumerate, which might
 * grow or shrink entryStore.
 *
 * If your enumerator wants to remove certain entries, but set aside pointers
 * to other entries that it retains, it can use JS_DHashTableRawRemove on the
 * entries to be removed, returning JS_DHASH_NEXT to skip them.  Likewise, if
 * you want to remove entries, but for some reason you do not want entryStore
 * to be shrunk or compressed, you can call JS_DHashTableRawRemove safely on
 * the entry being enumerated, rather than returning JS_DHASH_REMOVE.
