@defgroup crowd Crowd

Members in this module implement local steering and dynamic avoidance features.

The crowd is the big beast of the navigation features. It not only handles a 
lot of the path management for you, but also local steering and dynamic 
avoidance between members of the crowd. I.e. It can keep your agents from 
running into each other.

Main class: #dtCrowd

The #dtNavMeshQuery and #dtPathCorridor classes provide perfectly good, easy 
to use path planning features. But in the end they only give you points that 
your navigation client should be moving toward. When it comes to deciding things 
like agent velocity and steering to avoid other agents, that is up to you to 
implement. Unless, of course, you decide to use #dtCrowd.

Basically, you add an agent to the crowd, providing various configuration 
settings such as maximum speed and acceleration. You also provide a local 
target to more toward. The crowd manager then provides, with every update, the 
new agent position and velocity for the frame. The movement will be 
constrained to the navigation mesh, and steering will be applied to ensure 
agents managed by the crowd do not collide with each other.

This is very powerful feature set. But it comes with limitations.

The biggest limitation is that you must give control of the agent's position 
completely over to the crowd manager. You can update things like maximum speed 
and acceleration. But in order for the crowd manager to do its thing, it can't 
allow you to constantly be giving it overrides to position and velocity. So 
you give up direct control of the agent's movement. It belongs to the crowd.

The second biggest limitation revolves around the fact that the crowd manager 
deals with local planning. So the agent's target should never be more than 
256 polygons aways from its current position. If it is, you risk 
your agent failing to reach its target. So you may still need to do long 
distance planning and provide the crowd manager with intermediate targets.

Other significant limitations:

- All agents using the crowd manager will use the same #dtQueryFilter.
- Crowd management is relatively expensive. The maximum agents under crowd 
  management at any one time is between 20 and 30.  A good place to start
  is a maximum of 25 agents for 0.5ms per frame.

@note This is a summary list of members.  Use the index or search 
feature to find minor members.

@struct dtCrowdAgentParams
@see dtCrowdAgent, dtCrowd::addAgent(), dtCrowd::updateAgentParameters()

@var dtCrowdAgentParams::obstacleAvoidanceType
@par

#dtCrowd permits agents to use different avoidance configurations.  This value 
is the index of the #dtObstacleAvoidanceParams within the crowd.

@see dtObstacleAvoidanceParams, dtCrowd::setObstacleAvoidanceParams(), 
	 dtCrowd::getObstacleAvoidanceParams()

@var dtCrowdAgentParams::collisionQueryRange
@par

Collision elements include other agents and navigation mesh boundaries.

This value is often based on the agent radius and/or maximum speed. E.g. radius * 8

@var dtCrowdAgentParams::pathOptimizationRange
@par

Only applicalbe if #updateFlags includes the #DT_CROWD_OPTIMIZE_VIS flag.

This value is often based on the agent radius. E.g. radius * 30

@see dtPathCorridor::optimizePathVisibility()

@var dtCrowdAgentParams::separationWeight
@par

A higher value will result in agents trying to stay farther away from each other at 
the cost of more difficult steering in tight spaces.
