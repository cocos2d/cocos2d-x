## How to run tests

### Cocos Console

You can use [Cocos Console](www.cocos2d-x.org/wiki/Cocos2d-console) command line tool to run the test cases on almost all supported platforms.

In console application:
```
// Enter cpp test folder
cd tests/cpp-tests
// Or enter js test folder
cd tests/js-tests
// Or enter lua test folder
cd tests/lua-tests

// Compile or run test case
cocos compile -p ios|mac|android|win32|win8_1|metro|web -m debug|release
cocos run -p ios|mac|android|win32|win8_1|metro|web -m debug|release
```

For example, if you want to run cpp test in release mode on Android, you can use the following command:

```
cocos run -p android -m release
```

### Mac OSX & iOS

* Enter `cocos2d-x/build` folder, open `cocos2d_test.xcodeproj`
* Select `cpp-tests`, `lua-tests`, `js-tests` for `iOS` or `OS X` target in scheme toolbar
* Click `run` button

### Android

You can run the samples...

**Using command line:**

    $ cd cocos2d-x
    $ ./setup.py
    $ cd build
    $ ./android-build.py cpp-empty-test -p 10
    $ adb install cocos2d-x/tests/cpp-empty-test/proj.android/bin/CppEmptyTest-debug.apk

Then click item on Android device to run tests. Available value of `-p` is the API level, cocos2d-x supports from level 10.

**Using Eclipse:**

    $ cd cocos2d-x
    $ ./setup.py
    $ cd build
    $ ./android-build.py cpp-empty-test -p 10

Then

* Import cocos2d-x Android project into Eclipse, the path used to import is `cocos/2d/platform/android`
* Import `cpp-empty-test` Android project into Eclipse, the path used to import is `tests/cpp-empty-test/proj.android`
* Build `cpp-empty-test` Android project and run

### Windows

* For win32 project, enter `cocos2d-x/build`, and open `cocos2d-win32.sln`
* For win 8.1 project, enter `cocos2d-x/build`, and open `cocos2d-win8.1-universal.sln`
* For win 10 project, enter `cocos2d-x/build`, and open `cocos2d-win10.sln`
* Select running target
* Click run button

### Linux

    $ cd cocos2d-x/build
    $ ./install-deps-linux.sh
    $ cd ../..

Then

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake ../cocos2d-x
    $ make -j4

Run

    $ cd bin/cpp-empty-test
    $ ./cpp-empty-test

## How to start a new game

Use Cocos Console to create a new game:

```
cocos new -l cpp|js|lua MyNewGame
```

# v3.11

## Highlights features

* upgrade Chipmunk to v7.0.1
* use new memory model in JSB, don't have to invoke `retain/release` in JS, it is disabled by default
* support Tizen platform
* upgrade Culr to v7.48
* upgrade OpenSSL to 1.0.2g

## The main features in detail of Cocos2d-x v3.11

### New memory model in JSB

With new memory model, you don't have to care about object lifecycle. Which means you don't have to invoke `retain/release` in JS any more.

Though we have finished many tests about this new memory model, we can't make sure it is too perfect to enable it by default. But you are appreciated if you can enable it to have a try. If you want to enable it, you should:

```
TBD
```

### OpenSSL

Beginning July 11, 2016, Google Play will block publishing of any new apps or updates that use older versions of OpenSSL. So coocs2d-x upgrades OpenSSL to latest version(v1.0.2g).

If you use v2.x or use older versions of v3.x, you can just update CURL and OpenSSL. This guild shows you how to do. [TBD: Add guide link]() 

### Tizen support

TBD: doc links of Tizen
