The FacebookSDKResources.bundle is no longer required in order to use the SDK. You may provide a bundle in cases where you need to override strings or images (e.g. internationalization, etc.) See https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/ios/current/constants/FBSettings#resourceBundleName for more information.

The following is a list of keys for string localization:

/* FBLoginView (aka FBLV) */
"FBLV:LogOutButton" = "Log Out";
"FBLV:LogInButton" = "Log In";
"FBLV:LoggedInAs" = "Logged in as: %@";
"FBLV:LoggedInUsingFacebook" = "Logged in using Facebook";
"FBLV:LogOutAction" = "Log Out";
"FBLV:CancelAction" = "Cancel";

/* FBPlacePickerViewController (FBPPVC) */
"FBPPVC:NumWereHere" = "%@ were here";

/* FBError (aka FBE) */
"FBE:ReconnectApplication" = "Please log into this app again to reconnect your Facebook account.";
"FBE:PasswordChangedDevice" = "Your Facebook password has changed. To confirm your password, open Settings > Facebook and tap your name.";
"FBE:PasswordChanged" = "Your Facebook password has changed. Please log into this app again to reconnect your Facebook account.";
"FBE:WebLogIn" = "Your Facebook account is locked. Please log into www.facebook.com to continue.";
"FBE:AppNotInstalled" = "Please log into this app again to reconnect your Facebook account.";
"FBE:GrantPermission" = "This app doesnâ€™t have permission to do this. To change permissions, try logging into the app again.";
"FBE:Unconfirmed" = "Your Facebook account is locked. Please log into www.facebook.com to continue.";
"FBE:OAuthDevice" = "To use your Facebook account with this app, open Settings > Facebook and make sure this app is turned on.";
"FBE:DeviceError"= "Something went wrong. Please make sure you're connected to the internet and try again.";
"FBE:AlertMessageButton" = "OK";

Images should be placed in a directory called FacebookSDKImages in the bundle.  Note that images will support @2x and -568h@2x.
